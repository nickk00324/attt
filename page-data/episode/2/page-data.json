Her practice incorporates traditional Chinese Sumi painting techniques and geometric elements to depict the complexity of the Subject, agency, and corporeality, while building an alternative narrative of not only bodily experiences, but also intersubjective relations. Cheuk has exhibited in numerous exhibitions, including those at the Institute of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, Orange County Contemporary Art Center, Masur Museum, The Netura Museum, Culver Center for the Arts, Riverside Art Museum, Rochester Contemporary Art Museum, Wignall Museum of Contemporary Art, Chaffey Museum of Art, and The Robert & Frances Fullerton Museum of Art. She currently works as an instructor for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and received her BA at University of California, Riverside and MFA from California State University, San Bernardino."],"website":"https://sappycheuk.wixsite.com/works","ig":"https://instagram.com/sappycheuk"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e6b2a4b9-1211-5a3e-8468-1d7803c6d27e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
