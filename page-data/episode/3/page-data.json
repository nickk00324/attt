She is the founder of Settlers + Nomads, a collaborative curatorial project highlighting contemporary art and artists with ties to Las Vegas, Nevada. Recent projects include New Monuments for a Future Las Vegas and Water Slipping Through Our Fingers: An Art Memoriam to Lives Impacted by Police Violence at West Las Vegas Library.
