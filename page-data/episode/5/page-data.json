He thinks of the Las Vegas Strip as a richly textured and collaged landscape. He’s pursuing his MFA at UNLV to research Las Vegas, contemporary consumerism, American culture, ideology, nostalgia, and the spaces between high and low culture. He aims to push the boundaries of traditional printmaking techniques, bring printmaking into contact with sculptural installation, and combine sound and video elements in order to create immersive experiences. He earned a BFA in Printmaking with a minor in Art History from Arizona State University."],"website":"https://www.johnmcvayart.com/","ig":"https://instagram.com/punkboy7667"},{"name":"Erik Beehn","photo":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":400,"height":400,"src":"/attt/static/a0fe409af97584f754a7c5bb66fc6b3b/2244e/erik_beehn.jpg","srcSet":"/attt/static/a0fe409af97584f754a7c5bb66fc6b3b/2244e/erik_beehn.jpg 1x"}}},"bio":["Erik Beehn is an artist and educator working out of Las Vegas, Nevada.
