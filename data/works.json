      "bio": [
        "Trulee Hall was born in 1976 and raised near Atlanta, Georgia. She received her BFA from Atlanta College of Art in 1999 and her MFA from CalArts in 2006. She currently lives and works in Los Angeles. Hall’s richly textured practice spans video, painting, sculpture, sound, dance, and immersive installation, routinely employing diverse technical skills gleaned from her prior work in various creative industries.",
        "She began working in performance and video as an adolescent and developed a complex practice involving immersive sets, elaborate costumes, puppetry, claymation, and CGI. Her paintings, sculptures, and installations integrate with and inform facets of her videos and soundtracks in an overarching practice. Her choreographed videos of non-narrative, surreal, philosophical and symbolic systems employ a fiercely playful sense of humor, a patient appreciation for the mundane, and a love of the absurd.",
        "Hall currently has a major solo museum show at the Zabludowicz Collection in London up until July 17, 2021, where she also composed and performed a live Opera in March 2020. She has an upcoming solo museum show at the Villa Schöningen in Potsdam, Germany. She has work in the permanent collection at MOCA, LACMA, the Hammer Museum, The Rubell Family Museum, and the Zabludowicz Collection among many other prominent collections. Hall’s first solo gallery exhibition, ‘The Other and Otherwise’, was held at Maccarone Los Angeles in 2019. Other recent projects include her Infestation video & multistory sculptural installation at Paramount Studios for Frieze Projects (curated by Ali Subotnick) as part of the inaugural Frieze Los Angeles Art Fair (2019). Exhibitions and screenings of her work have been held at Deitch Gallery, the Rubell Family Collection, Hammer Museum, MOCA, Redcat, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), Los Angeles Nomadic Division (LAND), Human Resources LA, Barrick Museum of Art, Michael Benevento Gallery, OUTFEST LA, The Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Billy Wilder Theatre, Yale Union, Daata Editions among other numerous exhibitions and screenings internationally."

          "Keeva Lough is an artist with a focus on performances for photo and video. The daughter of a rural Oklahoma preacher, much of her childhood was spent reading in church. After a brief stint in art school, she began combining her knowledge of film history with group improvisations to create expanded narrative projects. In 2012 she received her BA in Film & Media Studies from the University of Oklahoma. An internship with a university video production department led to a career as a video and digital media producer. In 2017 she returned to her studio art practice out of spite. She is a current MFA candidate at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Her work has been shown in Oklahoma, Missouri, Nevada, Maryland, and France."

          "Tiffany Lin is a visual artist, wordsmith, and dreamer. Her projects investigate nebulous distinctions between want, need, and desire in context of political and capitalist spectacles. By manipulating vernacular language and signifiers of chance, she reveals how manifestations of want are informed by the nation state, free markets, and imperialist legacies. Previous collaborative partners include the Children's Discovery Museum of San José, Executives' Alliance for Boys and Men of Color, Museum of Impact, Litografiska Akademin Tidaholm, and the Uni Project."
